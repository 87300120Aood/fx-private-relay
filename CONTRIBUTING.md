# How to contribute
We welcome and appreciate input, ideas, and code from contributors.

For any user-facing change, please [submit
an issue for discussion first](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues/new). To keep our review
queue streamlined, if you submit your idea as a pull request with code changes,
we are likely to close it and ask you to submit an issue for discussion first.

Before you submit a new issue, please 
[search our existing issues](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues)
to see if your idea is already in there. If it is, please add a +1 vote to the
existing issue. We check our [issues sorted by
upvotes](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
when we plan and prioritize our work.

If you submit a PR for code changes, we will try to respond as quickly as we
can, but please be patient - especially if your change is large.
